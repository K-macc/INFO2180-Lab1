        <p>I am a 2nd year Computer Science major who hails from Montego Bay, St. James. Alongside being a CS major, I
            am the Public Relations Officer for Taylor Hall and the 2nd year representative for the Department of
            Computing. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and playing volleyball. In the future (God's willing), I want to
            become a software engineer. I am interested in Web Development because I love the concept of it and always
            told myself that I had to do some type of web development in my life whethere for personal or business needs
            or both.</p>
